THIS WILL BE INSTALLED IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER.
FIRSTLY, OPEN 'requirements.bat' TO INSTALL THE PACKAGES.
YOU MUST HAVE BOTH ROBLOX AND PYTHON INSTALLED.
RUN THE PYTHON FILE OR THE 'start.bat' FILE TO RUN THE CODE. THEN, PASTE IN A LINK OR AN ID FOR A SHIRT OR PANTS.

Download and install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Put in any Roblox shirt or pants URL or identification (ID) code and it will download the file. This does not steal your cookie, it is open source, inspect it yourself!

If you just want to test, I recommend you use this URL or ID:
`https://www.roblox.com/catalog/17453116137/pink-aero`
or `17453116137`


An ID is the number in the link that comes after `/catalog/` and before the name (`/name/`).

`https://www.roblox.com/catalog/*17453116137*/pink-aero`

ROBLOX INSTALLER IS PROVIDED TO YOU IN THE FOLDER THAT WILL BE MADE IN `C:\Users\HP\AppData\Local\Programs\ROBLOX-ASDL`
